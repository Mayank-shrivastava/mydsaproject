Class and Object
    -In object-oriented programming everything is just made of the object. But now the question is how objects are made
    -Objects are made by using Classes, so now the question arises that "What are classes in OOPS??"
    -Object - Instance of the class.
    -Class - It is blueprint of our object.
Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming:-
     -Easy to implement the real world problems by using the Object and giving them properties and behaviour.
     -Give modularity to our code -> By the use of (Data Abstraction and Hiding).
     -Give better re-usability -> Inheritance.
     -Give better maintainability to the code -> Polymorphism.
Access Specifiers:-
     -Private:- visible inside same class
     -Public:- visible everywhere
     -Protected:- visible inside same package and to the package of child class
     -Default:- visible inside same package
Getter and Setter:- Functions to get and set the private fields in the class
this keyword:- refers to the current object and used to differentiate between instance variables and local variables
Constructor:- (Default and parameterized constructor)
              -The main use of constructor is to initialize the object or we can say that initialize
                the instance variables of particular object
              -They have no return type and have same name as our class
              -They look like a function only
Static keyword:-
     -Properties which are specific to the class are named by static keyword before their name,
      whereas the properties which are not specific to the class are named non-static(no such keyword exist) before their name.
