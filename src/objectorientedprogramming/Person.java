    //class and object
    //In object-oriented programming everything is just made of the object. But now the question is how objects are made
    //Objects are made by using Classes, so now the question arises that "What are classes in OOPS??"
    //Object - Instance of the class.
    //Class - It is blueprint of our object.
    /*
     * Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming:-
     * 1.Easy to implement the real world problems by using the Object and giving them properties and behaviour.
     * 2.Give modularity to our code -> By the use of (Data Abstraction and Hiding).
     * 3.Give better reusability -> Inheritance.
     * 4.Give better maintability to the code -> Polymorphism.
     *
     * Properties which are not specific to the class are named by static keyword before their name,
     * whereas the properties which are specific to the class are named non-static keyword before their name.
